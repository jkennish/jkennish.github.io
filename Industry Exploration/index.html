A good chunk of my time with technology

Do you ever do something or look at something almost everyday that it starts to feel normal? You might also find yourself taking up a lot of your time and end up looking at the clock to see that you just spent fifteen to thirty minutes just looking at your phone screen. When it comes to using a mobile app, I'm sure we've all done it, and for me, that's what happens when I use Instagram. I like using Instagram because I'm very passionate about pictures and Instagram is full of pictures that people post. I like it because it's not full of political views, or people complaining about something, like you tend to see on Facebook, and honestly that can get very boring sometimes. I like to take time to get the perfect picture of my car and I love to share that with other people in the car community. I feel like I would fit right in at a company like Instagram. I really like coding and I feel like I would thrive in an environment like theirs. A challenge to me would be how to keep the current users happy, because if nothing new comes out or gets updated then it could start to get boring. Security would also be a big challenge because it seems like you always hear about how your typical celebrity got their account hacked.<p>

What it's like working at Instagram
</h2>
<div class="wrapper">
As you can imagine, Instagram headquarters is like most huge new-age company headquarters. Huge screens showcasing their brand as soon as you walk in as a guest of staff. The cafeteria is free, everything. They have many selections of vegan bread, salads, freshly cooked meals, and fully stocked snack boxes. I don't really know any other company that seems as chill and relaxed as Instagram, but on the other hand, I'm sure that's what most huge headquarters are like. They have an Android coding engineer, which is cool for me because I'm all for team android!<p>
